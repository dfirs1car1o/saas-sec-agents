## What This Repo Does

This system connects to SaaS platforms, runs OSCAL and CSA SSCF security assessments, and generates governance outputs for:
- **Application owners** — remediation backlog with priority actions and due dates (Markdown)
- **Security governance review** — full DOCX + Markdown report with Executive Scorecard, Domain Posture chart, NIST AI RMF review, and sorted control matrix

Platform controls chain through **platform OSCAL catalog → SSCF → CCM v4.1 → regulatory crosswalk** (SOX, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, GDPR) automatically.

The pipeline is fully agentic: `gpt-5.3-chat-latest` orchestrates 5 CLI tools and 7 specialist agents over a 14-turn ReAct loop. No human input needed once triggered.

## Bare Minimum to Run

```text
Python 3.11+  +  git  +  pip install -e .  +  .env with API keys
```

No Docker. No Node.js. No cloud accounts beyond OpenAI + Salesforce.

---

## Quick Start (Any Platform)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dfirs1car1o/saas-sec-agents.git
cd saas-sec-agents
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . && pip install pytest
cp .env.example .env   # fill in OPENAI_API_KEY + Salesforce credentials
pytest tests/ -v       # 12/12 should pass (offline, no API keys needed)
agent-loop run --dry-run --env dev --org test-org
```
